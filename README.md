# pydbm
Python package implementing the Dynamic Belief Model (DBM) by Yu and Cohen (2008).

This package is a lightweight Python package to implement the Dynamic Belief Model (DBM) by Yu and Cohen (2008). The DBM is a normative computational model from psychology. It can be used to et trial-to-trial estimates of the probability of an event occuring on a given trial, given the trial history before.
